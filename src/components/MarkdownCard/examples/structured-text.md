# Structured Text

This card demonstrates the different levels of headings available, and how they can be used to visually organise a large amount of text. Usually, a heading is chosen based on its level of _importance_ in a document, rather than chosen for how it looks. However, in this particular use case the appearance of the card is more important, and you should feel free to mix and match headings as you need to best present your information.

There are 6 levels of headings available, but in most cases you should avoid using more than 2 or 3 to represent information hierarchy, otherwise it becomes visually confusing for the reader.

## Subheadings

Each level of heading is a "subheading" of the previous one. When there is more than one subheading, remember that the number of # signs you put at the start relates to the _importance_ or the _size_ of the heading, not what "number" heading it is on the page. Usually you'll have one "level one" heading followed by several "level two" headings.

### Sub-subheadings

Each subheading may have its own subheadings.

Each heading can have one or more paragraphs displayed underneath it. Write the content as you would write a normal text document.

### Use as many as you need

This allows us to organise the paragraphs into a hierarchy.

You can also put additional information like lists, tables or iamges beneath a particular heading as needed.

## More Subheadings

Subheadings are not limited and you can use as many as you need, in whatever order you need. There are six level in total.
