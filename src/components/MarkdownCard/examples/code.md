# Code

Markdown supports two kinds of code blocks: **inline** (within other text) and **block** (in its own code container).

There is not currently any support for code highlighting.

## Inline Code

Use backticks to add formatted code like `myFunction.call()` in the middle of some text.

```
Use backticks to add formatted code like `myFunction.call()` in the middle of some text.
```

## Code Block

Use triple backticks on their own line before and after a code sample to display it as a code block.

```
function myFunction() {
  this.displayAsCode();
}
```

````
```
function myFunction() {
  this.displayAsCode();
}
```
````

## Fenced Code Block

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
