# Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet-point) list types. Nested lists are also supported.

## Ordered List

Add numbers at the start of sequential lines to create a numbered list.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## Unordered List

Add hyphens at the start of sequential lines to create a bullet list.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

## Nested List

Add two spaces at the start of a line to "nest" the bullet point

- First item
  - Sub-item
  - Another sub-item
- Second item
  - Like this, for example
- Third item
  - Can have a list
    - With yet another list
    - Underneath it
  - But try not to go too crazy!
